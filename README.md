# myPythonProjects
This repository is made to hold my python codes.
## university folder
This folder will have all the coding that I did for my course at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. The questions that I answered will be provided as well. The codes have comments to make them more understandable. For some of the codes, I had to use external files (such as pictures for image processing) which in that case those are provided as well. The Guide.md provides details on each project.
