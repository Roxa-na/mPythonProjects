The followings give a short description of what I have done for each exercise while taking an elective course **"Scientific programming with python"**. In case a picture or certain file was used, I have provided that in the folder.
## Exercise 1
This was the first exercise, therefore, the questions were simple calculations and inputting and outputting in python. The focus was put on using python's capabilities in handling lists and arrays.
## Exercise 2
The exercises done in this section focus on programming and writing algorithms. The questions could have solutions in simpler steps using **numpy**, however, it was asked to do without it.
## Exercise 3
This exercise focused on **loops** and **control statements**. In an exercise, writing functions in Python was asked as well.
## Exercise 4
In this exercise, the focus of the exercises were on **numpy** and **matplotlib**. The questions asked about plotting data in different format and chart with and without subplots of certain intervals. Also certain data from each interval as obtained. This data was used again in exercise 6.
## Exercise 5
**Working with matrices**, creating them, manipulating them and creating masks for them are done in this exercise. The other task was about **basic image processing**. The photo was of a sky and the tasks were to find the degree of cloudiness and finding a threshold value for the colored pixels.
The photo used in the exercise is provided as well.
## Exercise 6
For a certain set of data, **basic signal processing** was done. The **fourier transform** was calculated and its power spectrum was depicted. And in the other task, the focus was shifted to working with **polynomials** in Python with the help of numpy.
## Exercise 7
In this exercise, most of the focus was on **scipy, sympy, and numpy** from a mathematical point of view. **Solving differential equations**, finding the best polynomial fit for a given data, and solving differential equations numerically.
